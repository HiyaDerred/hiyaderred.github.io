    <center><h2>survivor (3/24/24)</h2></center>
    <h3>
        we're competing in a survivor challenge against an old veteran, seeing who can last the longest in a really weird lawn chair designed to break your posture.<br><br>
        There's even a temporary immunity system where if someone loses, they can go and mess with the other players, but are stopped by challenge immunity.<br><br>
        The old veteran was this really tall and buff guy chained to the side of a pyramid, calling the challenge easy, but isn't at all what anyone else was doing for the challenge.<br><br>
        A group of girl scouts come in to give me challenge immunity right as some random bully comes to mess up the challenge for me.<br><br>
        I do remarkably well in the challenge, with me in the top 3 or 4 due to gamer posture.<br><br>
        The dream cuts off near the end of the challenge but I'd like to think I won.<br><br>
        I was also blatantly cheating by readjusting my position multiple times and sometimes not even being on the chair but I guess jeff just didn't care enough to correct that.<br><br>
