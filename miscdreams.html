another constant with my dreams is half the time my parents just are not driving the car and like my brother is or something<br><br>
we get out of this rv rental place where we load up all the stuff for our trip to somewhere, with my brother driving the car (he’s 14) because my mom’s too tired or something, then play a commercial for some disney xd show looking thing where someone hops in a magical briefcase and gets transported to this old house to go look around. Outside of that briefcase is a different old house, being prepped for a party of sorts. I’m given a lightsaber with a giant battery for some reason, as I go ahead and hang up a bunch of party decorations for some reason, including my goofy goober drawing poster, then my dad starts to complain about my decorating skills as he’s eating nachos with a bunch of other people, meanwhile in the suitcase realm piggy from the muppets also gets a battery lightsaber, and the magical suitcase from earlier and her have a lightsaber duel, until someone else pops up (I forget who) and demonstrates that the batteries are the only power here and they’ll run out soon so just stop fighting anyway, which we do and other stuff happened but I waited too long to recount the dream

had a dream where the entire world learned of this meteor that was going to destroy the world, so one particular group of people go through multiple dimensions to figure out how to stop the meteor, even going into the third dimension from the phineas and ferb movie, a lot of time is spent figuring out ways to shoot it off course, and make sure it doesn’t hit earth too bad. With every avenue tried, all hope seems lost. Half the team leaves to be with their families, while the rest pray that something be done. Eventually, this one viking guy you can see just randomly shooting arrows into the sky, and he eventually hits the meteor and slows it down, and as it turns out this really big meteor was the size of a basketball and hit the water (also with less momentum because viking guy), and everyone celebrated because yayyyy not dead or something

<br><br><br>
(5/14/24)<br>
well ralsei, susie, and noelle were there 
<br><br><br>
(5/8/24)<br>
extremely posh british guy is talking about how death isn't covered in the media at all, mostly because the poor people die WAY too much, also the main topic of discussion (this is a video essay) is stanley parable, famously for its death
<br><br><br>
(5/5/24)<br>
had a dream where my parents were on a road on the side of a cliff, and on the edges of the cliff were a bunch of stray animals that we were zooooooming past, one of them got in front of us and then we veered off the cliff, then I woke up. I've had a lot of dreams akin to this in general, literally every time a dream takes place in a car that car crashes somehow
<br><br>
different dream where (to cadrega) we were walking down a sidewalk that looked vaguely familiar to across the globe’s, and we were holding hands (don’t ask how that’s supposed to work with her using her sweater sleeve and my hand being a cube), and we looked at each other, blushed profusely, then smiled, and then boxo trapped both of us in a cage and teased us about fruits
<br><br><br>
(4/29/24)<br>
(to cadrega) we were kinda just sitting on a log somewhere trying to talk, and you wouldn't really say anything and you'd display emotions on your screen face thing <br>
then we hugged
<br><br><br>
(4/4/24)<br>
I had a dream about going to an alternative timeline, and changing events around to suit my needs, to get the upper hand on life, but I revert the timeline back to normal to preserve it. Not before I go back and reset it, telling my Mom I'm 200 days older than when I started. We then partake in a game to get as many pails as possible to the other side of this obstacle course, which I win, and then technoblade gives a small monologue about how he won the challenge.
<br><br><br>
(4/3/24)<br>
There's this rat scratching on the back door of a house we're in, someone mistakenly opens that door and lets the rat in not knowing there's a million rats outside, I'm upset by this
<br><br><br>
(4/1/24)<br>
we're on this camping trip in an RV, my dog Axl materializes out of nothing during nighttime when everyone is asleep (but the RV still moves for some reason), and he's talking now also. He's talking about the millions of ant-sized people trapped in the desert with no hope of escape, and how I need to run and place them alongside the road to give them better lives?? I also climb on top of roofs at our destination to let the ant people have air

(1/18/24) <br>
played TF2 with Adrian, Gabriel, and Querky, in a small community map called maze that was annoying to play through. Nothing else happened.
<br><br><br>
(1/17/24) <br>
played raft with someone but it's a survival horror game with the backrooms where nowhere is safe, if you're too low to the ground the tunnelers will get you, and if you're too high SOMETHING gets you? Menacing music plays constantly. Also we're on land now instead of sea
<br><br><br>
(1/16/24) <br>
A bit fuzzy on the details I just remember making a portal 2 puzzle in minecraft and my uncle tells me it doesn't work because the stairs to a part of a puzzle are too hidden and not fun.
